random command :h3

[Syntax:]

random keyword value ...
random reset :pre

zero or more keyword/value pairs may be used :ulb,l
keyword = {style} or {seed} or {gauss} or {equal} or {read} or {write} :l
  {style} value = {mt} or {mars} or {pcg} or {park}
  {seed} value = random # seed (positive integer)
  {gauss} value = {ziggurat} or {polar} 
  {equal} value = {no} or {yes} 
  {write} value = rng status save file
  {read} value = rng status save file :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

random style pcg gauss ziggurat equal no
random style mt gauss polar
random seed 152345
random reset :pre

[Description:]

Set or change the default settings for random number generators.
LAMMPS has one persistent global random number generator which
is primarily used for obtaining {automatic} seeds for other
random number generator instances. These settings are applied
whenever a new random number generator instance is created,
e.g. by the "velocity"_velocity.html command or by fixes like
"fix langevin"_fix_langevin.html and so on. The global random
number generator will be instantiated with default settings.

The {style} keyword changes the setting for the random number
generator algorithm. Currently available choices are:
{mt}   (= Mersenne twister "(MT19937)"_#MT19937 ),
{mars} (= RANMARS from "(James)"_#James ),
{pcg}  (= Permuted congruential generator "(PCG)"_#PCG ),
{park} (= Park-Miller "(Park)"_#Park ).
The various algorithms differ in speed and quality of the
generated stream of random numbers. {pcg} and {mt} are very fast
and of high quality, {mars} is the slowest of the available choice,
but is known to work well with, e.g. with the {equal} {no} setting
with explicit seeds. {park} is mainly provided for backward
compatibility, its main advantage is that it needs to time to
be reinitialized.

The {gauss} keyword changes the method to produce gaussian
distributed random numbers. {polar} is the widely used Marsaglia
polar method "(Marsaglia)"_#Marsaglia , and {ziggurat} the more
efficient, but also the more complex algorithm "(Ziggurat)"_#Ziggurat
from the same author.

The {equal} keyword changes whether random number generators
should be seeded differently on different MPI ranks (= {no})
or whether they should use identical seeds (= yes) and thus
will produce identical streams of random numbers. Usually the
{no} setting is preferable.

The {write} keyword allows to write the sate of the persistent
global random number generator to a file. If the {equal} setting
for the active instance ([not] the current default setting)
is {yes} then only the state for one processor is saved, otherwise
the state from all processors are concatenated and written out.
The resulting file has two lines of readable text and then the
state buffers as unformatted binary data.

The {read} keyword allows to read back a previously save state
of the persistent global random number generator. Please note
that this will ignore the current default settings and leave
them untouched, but will restore the random number generator
to the settings used to create this instance.

The {reset} keyword recreates the global random number generator
using the current default settings. The {seed} keyword allows to
change the seed for operation. The seed must be a number larger
than zero.

[Default:]

The keyword defaults are style = pcg, gauss = ziggurat,
equal = no, seed = 19660405.
